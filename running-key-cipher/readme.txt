Fun story: I used this program to generate my passwords back in middle school.
I'd have a "master" password, then the encryption key was the name of the site.
(I've moved on to more secure password methodologies now)

Today, I learned in my cryptography class that this is a variation of a Vigen√®re cipher. Fascinating!
